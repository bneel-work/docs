ObserveX is built on four core concepts that form the backbone of the entire platform. Everything else dashboards, alerts, correlation, root cause analysis is built on top of these primitives.

## 1. MONITOR

A **Monitor** is any entity in your infrastructure that ObserveX watches. It's the "thing" being observed—could be physical hardware, virtual resources, software services, or logical constructs.

## 2. METRIC

A **Metric** is a numerical measurement captured at regular intervals. Metrics answer quantitative questions: how much, how many, how fast, what percentage.

## 3. LOG

A **Log** is a discrete event that occurred at a specific moment. Logs capture context that metrics cannot: error messages, stack traces, user IDs, request payloads, and arbitrary structured data.

## 4. TRACE

A **Trace** follows a single request as it travels across service boundaries. It reconstructs the complete journey from entry point through all downstream calls, showing exactly where time is spent and where failures occur.

### Trace Use Cases

| Question                                   | How Trace Answers It                                |
| :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Why is this endpoint slow?                 | Trace shows time breakdown per service/operation    |
| Where did the error originate?             | Error status propagates up span tree with source    |
| Which services handle this request?        | Trace maps complete service dependency path         |
| Is the database the bottleneck?            | Database spans show query timing relative to total  |
| What's the impact of this slow dependency? | Trace shows all requests waiting on that dependency |

## Quick Reference

| Concept     | Definition                      | Key Properties                        |
| :---------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| **Monitor** | The thing being observed        | Type, State, Metadata, Relationships  |
| **Metric**  | Numerical measurement over time | Name, Type, Value, Labels, Timestamp  |
| **Log**     | Discrete event with context     | Timestamp, Level, Message, Attributes |
| **Trace**   | Request journey across services | Trace ID, Spans, Duration, Status     |

| Signal     | Best For                        | Query Example                          |
| :--------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| **Metric** | Trends, alerting, dashboards    | "P99 latency over last hour"           |
| **Log**    | Debugging, audit, context       | "All errors containing order_id=12345" |
| **Trace**  | Request flow, latency breakdown | "Show all spans for trace abc123"      |

_These four concepts—Monitor, Metric, Log, Trace—are the atoms from which all observability is built._
